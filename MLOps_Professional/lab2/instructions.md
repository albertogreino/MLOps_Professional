# Lab Duration: 30 min

## Lab Learning Objective
To learn how to create clear and comprehensive architecture diagrams from given application specifications.

## Problem Statement
Your team at Fancy Orchards is ready to start building the predictive maintenance tool for improved service of apple harvesters. You have received a set of application specifications for a complex system with multiple components and interactions, which include:

- Data Streaming
- Raw Data Storage
- Real-time Data Processing Pipeline
- Model Inference Pipeline
- Inference Post-Processing
- User Interface
- Employee Maintenance Support Chatbot
- Add more as needed.

Your task is to create a component diagram that visually represents the system's structure, components, and their relationships. Remember that architecture diagrams can be highly subjective, so the important thing is to construct something easy to communicate to other team members. Add a few sentences describing the flow of the diagram to help other members of your team understand the application design.

## Value of Exercise
The lab will demonstrate the value of creating architecture diagrams for complex systems. Participants will learn to visually represent software architectures to communicate effectively with other team members, stakeholders, and developers. Clear architecture diagrams can aid in better understanding, efficient collaboration, and identifying potential design flaws early in development.

## Step-by-step Instructions for the Lab
1. Analyze application specifications: Carefully review the provided specifications to understand the system's requirements and components.
2. Identify system components: Identify the major components, services, and APIs that comprise the system.
3. Design the diagram: Use draw.io* to create the architecture diagram.

4. Define component relationships: Represent the interactions and dependencies between different components.
5. Document key features: Add descriptions or annotations to explain the purpose and functionality of each component.
6. Group related components: Organize the diagram to highlight logical groupings of components and sub-systems.
7. Review and refine the architecture diagram for accuracy and clarity and make necessary refinements.
8. Describe Flow: Write a few sentences to describe the logic and flow of data, requests, and transactions across the application.

## Challenge Questions
1. What are the benefits of creating architecture diagrams for software systems?
2. How can architecture diagrams aid in communicating with non-technical stakeholders?
3. What design principles should be considered while creating architecture diagrams?
4. Describe a scenario where modifying one component in the architecture might impact other components.

## Challenge Question Answers
1. Architecture diagrams visually represent the system's design, making understanding complex structures and relationships easier. They facilitate effective communication among team members, stakeholders, and developers. Diagrams can also serve as documentation, aiding in maintenance and troubleshooting.
2. Architecture diagrams use visual elements that are easier for non-technical stakeholders to comprehend than technical documentation. They allow stakeholders to grasp the system's overall design, potential risks, and impacts on business objectives.
3. When creating architecture diagrams, consider principles like modularity, loose coupling, and high cohesion. Strive for simplicity, avoiding unnecessary complexities. Additionally, ensure consistency with the actual implementation of the system.
4. For example, if a new feature is added to a component, it might require changes to the APIs exposed by that component. These changes can affect other components that rely on those APIs, leading to a ripple effect of modifications across the architecture.
